# Net

Net, also known as WillieNet, is an onchain decentralized messaging protocol for EVM blockchains. Anybody can read messages and send message on WillieNet, where all messages live fully onchain and are easily queryable onchain. There is no cost to interact with WillieNet outside of gas fees.

## Protocol

The smart contracts for WillieNet live in the `protocol` directory. Visit the protocol directory to explore the WillieNet protocol.

There is not yet a canonical deployment for WillieNet on mainnet. The readme will be updated once there is.

## Dapp

This repo provides a dapp that allows you to interact with WillieNet in the `website` directory. That said, anybody can build a dapp to interact with WillieNet.

Currently, the dapp only allows you to interact with WillieNet on the Base Sepolia testnet.
